# Seattle Crime Map

The reason why we decided to create the application, Seattle Crime Map, is because we all are international students studying at University of Washington Seattle, and compared to the situations in our countries, we feel insecure with living on the campus when hearing the sirens of police cars, or encountering a situation where a suspicious person was running amok on campus late at night. However, at the same time, given that we all students have to defend ourselves from such dangerous cases, we came to think that we should be able to create any mapping tool to catch up the visual information on recent crimes happening around this city that are automatically updated with dataset provided by the Seattle Police Department. 
(cf. https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)

Information about recent crimes will be displayed in the header of the screen, updated as needed.
